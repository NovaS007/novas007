# Hi, I’m Nova 👋

I’m a **Computer Science + Math** double major (Honors student) with a soft spot for **code, sharp proofs, and practical data**. I like building things that are both *correct* and *useful*, and I’m especially interested in work that improves **accessibility** and **student support in STEM**.

## What I’m into
- **Software development** (particularly back-end development)
- **Data science / statistics** (Long-term: PhD in Statistics with a focus on computational epidemiology)
- **Accessibility & ADA work** (I’m an ADA technician intern through my university’s CIT department)
- **Game dev experiments** (Worked in a moderate-sized team to make a simple demo for a 2D platformer with a custom-made engine. I am also currently poking at **Godot**, making a Stardew Valley and Slime Rancher-inspired farming sim)

## Stuff I’ve worked on / am working on
- A **Java + MySQL** project with a layered architecture (DAO/POJOs/DB manager) for storing and querying **video game info**
- **R** for applied statistics coursework (data wrangling + analysis + visualizations)
- A small **Chebyshev’s Theorem demo** through Python using Matplotlib and Tkinter

## Tools & skills
- **Languages:** Java, Python, R, SQL  
- **Also:** Git/GitHub, LaTeX
- **Favorite tools:** JetBrains IDEs

## Fun facts
- Favorite video games of all time: **Xenoblade Chronicles** and **Stardew Valley**
- I’m a **Nintendo** enjoyer, and I have an unreasonable appreciation for well-designed game systems

⭐ If you’re browsing my repos: expect a mix of **class projects and homework, math/code experiments, and game-dev prototypes**.
