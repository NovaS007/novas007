# Hi, I’m Nova Smith 👋

I’m a **Computer Science + Math** double major (Honors student) with a soft spot for **clean code, sharp proofs, and practical data**. I like building things that are both *correct* and *useful*—and I’m especially interested in work that improves **accessibility** and **student support in STEM**.

## What I’m into
- **Software development** (my current post-grad direction)
- **Data science / statistics** (long-term: master’s in stats, and I’m intrigued by computational modeling)
- **Accessibility & ADA work** (I’m an ADA technician intern through my university’s IT/CIT department)
- **Game dev experiments** (currently poking at **Godot** with a simple 2D platformer)

## Stuff I’ve worked on / am working on
- A **Java + MySQL** project with a layered architecture (DAO/POJOs/DB manager) for storing and querying **video game info**
- **R** for applied statistics coursework (data wrangling + analysis + visualizations)
- A small **Chebyshev’s Theorem demo** (because math deserves nice UI sometimes)

## Tools & skills
- **Languages:** Java, Python, R, SQL  
- **Also:** Git/GitHub, LaTeX (I’m picky about formatting), relational databases  
- **Favorite tools:** JetBrains IDEs (yes, I’m that person)

## Fun facts
- Favorite game of all time: **Xenoblade Chronicles**
- I’m a **Nintendo** enjoyer and I have an unreasonable appreciation for well-designed game systems (yes, even gacha mechanics)

⭐ If you’re browsing my repos: expect a mix of **class projects, math/code experiments, and game-dev prototypes**.
